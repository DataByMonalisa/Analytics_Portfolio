# Bakery Data Analysis using SQL
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing customer, sales, and purchasing behavior data for a bakery business using structured query language (SQL). The dataset, derived from transactional records, provides insights into customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and revenue trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for business growth and optimization.
## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on bakery sales data.
* Extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, revenue generation, and seasonal trends.
* Develop SQL queries to answer critical business questions.
* Provide actionable recommendations based on data analysis results.
## Dataset Description
The dataset includes information such as:
### Customer demographics (age, gender, loyalty membership).
* Transaction details (items purchased, amount spent, payment methods).
* Temporal data (purchase dates and times).
## This project uses SQL queries to transform, analyze, and visualize this data for comprehensive insights.
