# Supply Chain Optimisation Analysis
Supply Chain Optimization Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing supply chain operations using interactive dashboards created in Tableau. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to improve inventory management, shipping efficiency, and overall supply chain performance.

### Objectives

* Analyze demand vs. stock levels to improve inventory turnover.
* Optimize shipping costs and times across different carriers and routes.
* Evaluate supplier performance through defect rates and lead times.
*Identify revenue trends by customer demographics.
* Provide actionable insights to enhance supply chain efficiency.

### Dataset Overview

#### The dataset includes:

* Product Data: Product type, SKU, price, inventory levels, and sales.
* Customer Data: Demographics (gender) and revenue contributions.
* Supplier Data: Supplier name, location, lead times, and defect rates.
* Shipping Data: Shipping carriers, transportation modes, routes, costs, and times.

### Key Visualizations and Insights

#### 1. Demand vs. Stock Levels

<b> Visualization: </b> Dual-axis chart comparing number of products sold and inventory levels.

<b> Insight: </b> Products like SKU3 and SKU5 show significant stock shortages, indicating potential stockouts.

<b> Recommendation: </b> Increase inventory for high-demand products to meet customer needs.

#### 2. Revenue by Product Type

<b> Visualization: </b> Bar chart showing revenue contributions by product type.

<b> Insight: </b> Haircare products generate the highest revenue, followed by skincare and cosmetics.

<b> Recommendation: </b> Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue product types to boost sales further.

#### 3. Shipping Costs by Location

<b> Visualization: </b> Map highlighting shipping costs across locations.

<b> Insight: </b> Chennai has the highest shipping costs compared to other locations.

<b> Recommendation: </b> Optimize carrier selection and explore alternative routes for Chennai.

#### 4. Defect Rate by Supplier

<b> Visualization: </b> Bar chart showing defect rates by supplier.

<b> Insight: </b> Supplier 1 has the highest defect rate, impacting product quality.

<b> Recommendation: </b> Conduct supplier audits and negotiate quality improvement plans.

#### 5. Revenue by Customer Demographics

<b> Visualization: </b> Bar chart showing revenue contributions by customer demographics.

<b> Insight: </b> Female customers contribute the highest revenue, followed by non-binary and male customers.

<b> Recommendation: </b> Tailor marketing strategies to the dominant demographic group to maximize revenue.

### Key Metrics

<b> Inventory Turnover: </b> “Products sold” divided by “Stock levels” to assess efficiency.
