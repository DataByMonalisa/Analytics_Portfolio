# Customer Churn Analysis with Power BI
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecommunications company using Power BI. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we uncover key trends and insights to help the company improve customer retention and optimize business strategies.
## Objective
* Identify factors contributing to customer churn.
* Visualize churn trends across demographics, services, and geographic locations.
* Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction.
## Dataset
* Name: Customer Churn Dataset
* Source: Kaggle
* Key Features:
   + Customer Demographics: Gender, age, senior citizen status, dependents.
   + Services: Internet service, streaming TV, streaming movies, tech support.
   + Contract Details: Contract type, payment method, tenure, monthly charges.
   + Geographic Information: Country, state, and city.
   + Outcome: Churn label and churn reasons.
## Key Analyses and Visualizations
  1. Overall Churn Rate:
       - Pie chart showing the percentage of churned vs. retained customers.
  2. Churn by Demographics:
       - Bar charts analyzing churn rates based on gender, senior citizens, and dependents.
  3. Churn by Services:
       - Visualizations exploring the impact of internet service, streaming services, and tech support on churn.
  4. Churn by Contract and Payment:
       - Charts highlighting churn trends by contract type, payment method, and tenure groups.
  5. Geographic Distribution:
       - Map visualization showing churn patterns across countries, states, and cities.
## Tools and Techniques
* Power BI:
     - Data cleaning and transformation.
     - Interactive dashboards and visualizations.
* Excel:
     - Initial data preprocessing (handling missing values and formatting).
## Insights and Recommendations
 * High churn among month-to-month contract customers:
    - Suggest offering discounts or incentives to switch to longer-term contracts.
 * Higher churn for customers using electronic checks:
    - Recommend promoting auto-pay or credit card payment options.
* Demographic patterns:
    - Senior citizens and customers without dependents show higher churn rates, suggesting a need for targeted retention efforts.
* Service gaps:
    - Customers without streaming services or tech support are more likely to churn, indicating upsell opportunities.
* Regional trends:
    - High churn observed in specific cities and states, enabling localized retention campaigns.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in understanding and addressing customer churn. The insights gained can help businesses make informed decisions to improve customer retention and optimize service offerings.
